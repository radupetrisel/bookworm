# Bookworm

This is project 11 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bookworm-introduction)). This project is an app to track which books youâ€™ve read and what you thought of them.

As with previous projects, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges that I will complete on my own.
