# Bookworm

This is project 11 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bookworm-introduction)). This project is an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them.

As with previous projects, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges that I will complete on my own.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: Right now it’s possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.

**Challenge #2**: Modify ContentView so that books rated as 1 star are highlighted somehow, such as having their name shown in red.

**Challenge #3**: Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning Date.now to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
